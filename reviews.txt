I absolutely loved this place. The atmosphere was great and the staff were friendly.
Terrible experience. The food was cold and the service was slow.
Amazing product! Fast delivery and excellent customer support.
Would not recommend. The quality was below average and not worth the price.
Had a great time. Everything was perfect and just as described.
Disappointed. The item arrived damaged and no one responded to my complaint.
Five stars! I’ll definitely come back again.
Worst purchase ever. Complete waste of money.
Very satisfied with my order. Everything came on time and in perfect condition.
Not what I expected. The pictures were misleading.
Awesome! Great value for money.
Rude staff and unhelpful service. Never again.
Loved it! Highly recommended.
Product doesn’t match the description. Not happy.
Exceeded my expectations. Great quality and fast shipping.
Too expensive for what you get.
Perfect gift. My friend was thrilled!
Item didn’t work at all. Had to return it.
One of the best purchases I’ve made this year.
Really poor packaging. Box was crushed on arrival.
